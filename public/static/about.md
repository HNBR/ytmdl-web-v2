# Ytmdl

An app that lets you download music in the highest quality possible with metadata from various sources embedded into the song.

### What is it?

Ytmdl started as a CLI project as can be seen [here](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl). The CLI version is still in active development, however a lot of people were complaining that the CLI version doesn't support Windows. I gave it some thought and at the time I was also learning VueJS and fancied building a proper WebApp so I ended up building this, the Web version of Ytmdl.

> As of 14 January, 2021, `ytmdl` works out of the box on Windows. Cheers!

### What does it do?

This is an app that addresses a major problem that people face with the tools used currently, which is easily getting high-quality songs *with* metadata. Such empty-looking songs without metadata were creating a mess in my library, so I decided to build this tool. It gets the audio from YouTube using tools like `youtube-dl` in the backend and processes the songs and adds high quality metadata to them from various sources like iTunes and Last.fm.

### Who are you?

You can check my personal page [here](https://deepjyoti30.dev). I am a Full Stack developer and I really like building useful tools. I love using and customizing Linux. I'll be honest, Linux is how I ended up building the CLI version of `ytmdl` and now this web version. Oh, BTW, I use Arch :-p.
